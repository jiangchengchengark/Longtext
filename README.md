# LongText: Long-Text Task Design and Dataset

## Introduction
The `LongText` project aims to design reasonable long-text tasks and provide datasets for different stages of long-text processing. The datasets are organized in a conversational format and are available in English. The project is planned to cover text lengths ranging from 2K to 320K words, divided into multiple stages.

## Dataset Format
All datasets are organized in a conversational format, with each entry representing a dialogue or interaction. This format is designed to facilitate the development of models that can handle long-text conversations effectively.

## Dataset Language
The datasets are exclusively in English to ensure consistency and accessibility for a wide range of researchers and developers.

## Getting Started
To get started with the `LongText` project, you can download the available datasets and explore the conversational formats. We encourage contributions and feedback to help improve the datasets and expand the project.
